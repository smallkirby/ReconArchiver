# Recon Archiver
Tools and scripts I use in daily lives to archive data on the web.  
Memories should be kept in our mind, but it's not enough. They should be kept in an actual memory.

## Usage
- These tools are mostly intended to be used as cron tasks.
- Some of them run as a service and receives webhooks.
- Collected data is archived into tar ball.
- Archived data is automatically sent to remote drives. (This repo wouldn't include these code.)

## Appendix Tools
- Some of code is not for collecting/archinving data.
- Access web services of my accounts to check whether my `private` account is accidentaly published or not. 

## Target data
- Blog
- Twitter
- Github
- And other deletable media.
